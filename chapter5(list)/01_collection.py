# 2. Dictionary {}
# 3. Sets {}
# 4. Tuples ()

# It is a collection of object type element.
# It is dynamic.
# It is denoted by []
# It is mutable (change)
# It is a class of collection
# List is very slow than tuples

# 2. Dictionary :- Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
# It is denoted by {}.
# It is dynamic.

# Dictionary key can be any type of data.(int, string)
# Key cannot be null or duplicate.
# It is a unordered collection of data.
# It is a class of collection.

# 3. Sets :- Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# It is denoted by {}
# It is mutable.
# It have no order.
# It is dynamic.
# It reduce duplicate value automatically.
# It is a class of collection.
# It is useful for mathematical opertaions.
