## features of oops :-
# 1. Polymorphism
# 2. Inheritance
# 3. Abstraction
# 4. Encapsulation

#### ------------ polymorphism -------------- ####
### 1. polymorphism :- One word to different work is called polymorphism.
## --- we have two types of polymorphism --- 
# 1. Runtime polymorphism
# 2. Compile time polymorphism

# 1.1 . Run time polymorphism :-
# - Dynamic binding
# - Late binding
# - Method overriding :- We have a two class have a same name method child class method will be override parent class method

# 1.2 . Compile time polymorphism
# - Static binding
# - Early binding
# - Method overloading :- We have one class have a more than one same name method with a diffrent signature is called method overloading.

# *** python does not support compile time polymorphism (method overloading) *** #

#### ------------ inheritance -------------- ####
# 2. Inheritance :- It is useful for sharing of code.
# It reduce the code complexicity of code.
# It increase performance of code.
# It is sharing your memory code.

## ---- we have some type of inhertiance ----
# 1. single level 
# 2. multilevel
# 3. multiple 
# 4. hierarchical
# 5. hybrid

# 1.1. single level inheritance :- In a single level inheritance child class inherit all property of parent class.

# 1.2. multilevel inheritance :- In a multilevel inheritance , A child class can be derived from more than one parent(base) classes in Python.

# 1.3. multiple inheritance :- In a multiple inheritance we have more than one parent class and here child class inherit all property of the all parents class.

# 1.4. hierarchical inheritance :- When more than one (child) derived classes are created from a single base (parent) class.

# 1.5. hybrid inheritance :- It is a combination of all type of inheritance.

##### -------- Encapsulation ---------- #####
# 3. Encapsulation :- It combine overall data in a single unit is called encapsulation.

# Example :- Class is a best example of encapsulation.

## --- we have a two methods to access (change the code) ---
# 1. getter :- get method also return a private value.
# 2. setter :- set method initlized a new value of private member.

##### -------- Abstraction ---------- #####
# 4. Abstraction :- It shows the external property and hide the internal property.
# It implimented by the abstract class.

### abstract class :- An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes.
# It is not a pure incomplete class.
# It incomplete method implimented in drive class.
# It create template of implimentation.
# We cannot create a object of abstract class.
